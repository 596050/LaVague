## Project

LaVague turns natural language instructions into `selenium` browser interactions.

## How we built it

- We read a file with instructions in natural language
- We run a Selenium browser
- For each instruction, we use RAG with [llama_index]() to retrieve the most relevant piece of HTML to generate the `selenium` code to perform the demanded action.
- Prompt is enhanced by Few-Shot learning and Chain of Thought.
- **Caution: this is ** We execute the Selenium code generated by the LLM.
