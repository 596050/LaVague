Your goal is to write Selenium code to answer queries.

Your answer must be a Python markdown only.
You can have access to external websites and libraries.

You can assume the following code has been executed:
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
```

    <h1>Welcome to the Mock Page</h1>
    <div id="links">

        <a href="https://www.example.com" id="link3">External Link</a>

Query: Click on the title 'External Link'

Completion: 
```python
# Let's proceed step by step.
# First we need to identify the component first, then we can click on it.

# Based on the HTML, the link can be uniquely identified using the ID "link3"
# Let's use this ID with Selenium to identify the link
link_to_click = driver.find_element(By.ID, "link3")

# Then we click on the link
link_to_click.click()
```

HTML:

Query: Go on Llama Index Docs website

Completion: 
```python
# Let's proceed step by step.
# We need to go to the website of 'Llama Index Docs'
# To do so, we have to first get the URL of the website and then navigate to it

# First let's use SerpApi to get the URL of the website
from serpapi import GoogleSearch
import os

# We assume that the API key is stored in the environment variable "SERPAPI_KEY
params = {{
"q": "Llama Index Docs",
"google_domain": "google.com",
"api_key": os.environ["SERPAPI_KEY"]
}}

# We do a search on Google and get the first result
search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()
url = results["organic_results"][0]["link"]

# Then we can navigate to the website using Selenium
driver.get(url)
```

    <p id="para3">This is the third paragraph, which we will select and copy.</p>
    <p id="para4">This is the fourth paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

Query: Select the text inside the third paragraph

Completion: 
```python
# Let's proceed step by step.

# To select a paragraph, we can execute a JS script to select the text using the DOM
# In the provided HTML, the third paragraph can be identified using the ID "para3"
# We need to use getElementById to select the paragraph precisely
js_script = """
    // This part depends on the specific HTML, here is the identified ID "para3"
    var para = document.getElementById('para3');
    // The rest is standard
    if (document.body.createTextRange) {{ 
        var range = document.body.createTextRange();
        range.moveToElementText(para);
        range.select();
    }} else if (window.getSelection) {{
        var selection = window.getSelection();        
        var range = document.createRange();
        range.selectNodeContents(para);
        selection.removeAllRanges();
        selection.addRange(range);
    }}
"""

# Then we execute JavaScript
driver.execute_script(js_script)
```

HTML:

Query: Scroll up a bit

Completion: 
```python
# Let's proceed step by step.
# We don't need to use the HTML data as this is a stateless operation.
# 200 pixels should be sufficient. Let's execute the JavaScript to scroll up.

driver.execute_script("window.scrollBy(0, 200)")
```
